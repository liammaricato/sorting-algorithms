# sorting-algorithms

ðŸ”€ An attempt to come up with good solutions for most sorting algorithms just to practice programming logic

## Contextualizing
Scrolling through Youtube and searching for something to bring an end to my boredom I once stumbled upon a [video](https://youtu.be/aXXWXz5rF64), a simple animation illustrating how sorting algorithms worked. It was actually a series of videos, comparing different sorting algs and their efficiency. I was really amazed by it, specially because I never actually knew how many sorting algorithms existed, or even how they worked. Then I thought "Well I could maybe do that, it may not be the prettiest algorithm, nor the most efficient, but it could be done". So here we are! I thought I would create my own alg first, and then look through the internet for a better version of it and commit both to this repo for comparison, I'm not planning to just copy/paste the better alg here, but to actually understand and remake mine based on it. Hope you enjoy!

## Progress
For now, I'm focusing only on these 4 algorithms. If this keeps going, I could add some others like insertion sort.
